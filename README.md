# Kickstarter Analysis

1)
•	If you’re going to start a Kickstart campaign don’t launch it in December (excluding possibly something such as a Christmas or winter themed play or good).  December’s the only month which produces more failed projects than successful with the vast majority of other months not even being particularly close in favor of success.

•	Not surprisingly, the data confirms the lower the project goal the higher the chances are you will successfully raise and bypass the campaign goal.  As you put the data into buckets on the goal amount like we did you see irrefutable parallel between goal amount and success rate only broken when you reach buckets with less than 55 total projects, far too small of a sample size to discredit the clear trend displayed.

•	Music is far and away has the highest rate of success of Kickstart projects at 77% while Theater provides the majority of projects in terms of quantity.


2)	The greatest limitation of the data set is not knowing the details behind the campaigns. What was their strategy? When did they launch it and why? All important questions in addition to the data on figuring out why different campaigns are or are not successful.

3)	I would be interested to know if there was a correlation between number of backers and average backer amount. Do more successful campaigns go for a higher quantity at a smaller amount or vice versa or is there no correlation at all.  Also, I would like to look at the average length of the campaigns that are successful and failed.
